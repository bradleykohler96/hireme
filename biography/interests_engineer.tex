Words that I live by:
\begin{flushleft}
\begin{quote}
```\textit{Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit.} \\
   \textit{Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated.} \\
   \textit{...} \\
   \textit{In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.} \\
   \textit{There should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it.} \\
   \textit{Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.} \\
   \textit{Now is better than never.  Although never is often better than \textbf{right} now.} \\
   \textit{If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.} \\
   \textit{If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.}

My engineering interests include but are not limited to:
\newline
\begin{cvitems}
  \item Beautiful, elegant design followed by powerful, practical implementation
  \item Creating the things that better our lives and do not make them \textbf{more} complicated
  \item Doing the things that benefit others and not just yourself
  \item Software and computers unless I'm debugging
\end{cvitems}
