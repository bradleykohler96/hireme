Iâ€™m a second-generation Canadian, born and raised in Cambridge, Ontario. Cambridge is known for its rich history and vibrant community. Growing up there shaped my values and curiosity, particularly in understanding how things work around me. My grandparents were very inspiring, prevailing with kindness in their aspiration for a better life in Canada. From them, I inherited a strong connection to my German heritage and continue to learn and speak the language today.
