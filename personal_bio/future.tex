Looking ahead, I aspire to become a systems architect - someone who not only writes code but designs the structure, behaviour, and long-term sustainability of complex embedded systems.
I want to lead the development of technologies that are both technically sound and commercially meaningful.
My goal is to build products that solve real-world problems, scale gracefully, and leave a lasting mark on the market.
Whether it's in wireless communication, edge computing, or intelligent devices, I'm driven by the challenge of bringing together hardware, software, and user needs into systems that genuinely matter.
