I'm particularly drawn to engineering that bridges hardware and software - where real-time contraints, physical systems, and code all converge.
I'm fascinated by embedded systems, wireless communication protocols, and signal processing, especially in contexts where performance, reliability and resource constraints matter.
I enjoy working on firmware that communicates with sensors, handles concurrency, or optimizes low-level execution.
Whether it's building a custom protocol stack, debugging systems that interact with the physical world, I'm most engaged when solving problems that require both abstraction and precision.
