  \item[] \textbf{Drawing and Art} \newline
  I have always been a very artistic person; sketching everything from buildings to people and animals. \\
  I view myself as an artist before a programmer because I pay very close attention to detail. \\
  I like when people take the time to visually represent something because it helps my understanding.
  \item[] \textbf{Family and Friends} \newline
  I am a very social person.  I spend a lot of my time having fun with my friends and family.
  \item[] \textbf{Music and Piano} \newline
  I have played the piano for many years and enjoy playing modern and classical music. \\
  Music has had numerous benefits on my life including reducing stress and anxiety.
  \item[] \textbf{Automate Everything} \newline
  If I can automate something in my life I will try to find the time to do it. \\
  I like to write code on my spare time that makes my life a little easier.
