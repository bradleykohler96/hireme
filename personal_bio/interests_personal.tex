Outside of engineering, I enjoy projects that involve creativity and systems thinking.
I'm into open-source software, and hands-on work like DIY electronics or mechanical design.
I find satisfaction in building things that are both functional and elegant, whether it's a tool, a workflow, or a physical object.
In my downtime, I like hiking, playing the piano, and reading about the history of technology, and exploring how complex systems - from audio gear to ecosystems - work and evolve.
I value independence, precision, and curiosity in both my hobbies and my daily life.
