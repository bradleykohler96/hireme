## About me

I'm a Toronto-based embedded systems developer with a B.Eng. in Mechatronics Engineering (Co-op) from McMaster University and 6 years of hands-on experience in the field.
I specialize in building low-level firmware, wireless communication stacks (ZigBee, BLE, LTE NB-IoT), and system-level tools that bridge hardware and software.
My focus is on reliable, real-time C/C++ systems that deliver meaningful performance and impact.
I'm passionate about scalable embedded solutions and always looking to contribute to projects that solve real-world problems with elegance and precision.

My skills include (but are not limited to): <br />
